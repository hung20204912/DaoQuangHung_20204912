Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors for a class with different parameters. This is known as constructor overloading. In this case, you can create one constructor that takes the title as a parameter and another constructor that takes the category as a parameter. Both constructors can have different sets of parameters, and Java will automatically choose the appropriate constructor based on the parameters provided at the time of object creation.

Here's an example of how you can create multiple constructors for a DVD class:

public class DigitalVideoDisc {
    private String title;
    private String category;
    private String director;
    private int length;
    private float cost;

    public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public DigitalVideoDisc(String category, String director, int length, float cost) {
        this.category = category;
        this.director = director;
        this.length = length;
        this.cost = cost;
    }

    // other methods and constructors
}

In this example, the first constructor takes only the title parameter, while the second constructor takes the category, director, length, and cost parameters. Both constructors can be used to create a DVD object, depending on which parameters are provided.
